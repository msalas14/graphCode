    '''steps to get the solution to draw'''
     use the last {index} or N^2 -1 to store point
     store point of the value of the last index (*store the value as the next index*)
     line for those two points
     use prev point
     * store point of the value of this index (*store the value as the next index*)
     until index is 0???
